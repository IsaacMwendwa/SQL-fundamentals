## Introduction
This repo contains the code for a dashboard of Multiple Coordinated and Interactive Visualizations in D3.js. The dataset used for this project is the a1-cars.csv dataset, which can be found at [DataViz Datasets](https://github.com/IsaacMwendwa/dataViz-datasets). The Visualization charts implemented are:
1. Bubble Chart
2. Histogram
3. Connected Scatter Plot
4. Heat map

## Installation
No installation of packages or libraries is needed, as I directly link to the hosted D3.js script

## Usage
Ensure you have Internet connectivity, and double-click the index.html file to open it on a browser, so as to view the visualizations
